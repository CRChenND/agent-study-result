How does the rent affordability calculator work?
------------------------------------------------

Enter your desired location and annual income to see the
recommended monthly rent based on the "30% rule." For a more
precise picture of how much rent you can afford, enter variables
like your monthly expenses, savings, and debts. Adjust the slider
between 20%-40% to see how different rent-to-income percentages
change your budget and rental options.

Disclaimer: This calculator provides only a general estimate, and
is for educational purposes only. The estimates are based on
information provided by you, and should not be used as your sole
source of information. The output from this tool is not an offer
or solicitation, nor is it financial, or legal advice.


What percentage of my income should go to rent?
-----------------------------------------------

As a rule of thumb, your monthly rent shouldn't exceed 30% of your
gross monthly income. This leaves 70% of your gross monthly income
to cover other expenses.

For example, if you make $50,000 per year and follow the "30%
rule," you'd have $15,000 annually - up to $1,250 per month - to
spend on rent. This leaves $2,900 per month for all other
expenses.

The 30% rule is a standard guideline, but doesn't necessarily
apply to everyone. The exact percentage you should spend on rent
will vary depending on your income, location, cost of living, debt
payments, and financial goals.
