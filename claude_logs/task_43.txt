INFO     [agent] 🧠 Memory: I've attempted to check John Davis's trip information using his last name 'Davis' and first tried his confirmation code '123456', then his 13-digit ticket number '3329456534543'.

The form fields are still showing, which indicates the search may not have processed correctly or there might be additional information needed. I need to try a different approach to find John Davis's trip information.
