I've been trying to fill out the customer information form on step 6 of 8, but I notice the current appointment is for a Motorcycle Skills Test, not a knowledge test as required. I clicked Back to try changing the test type, but I'm still on the same page. I need to find a way to change the test type from Skills Test to Knowledge Test. Current appointment: Motorcycle Skills Test at Abingdon on Monday March 24, 2025, 8:30 AM. Current date is April 8, 2025.
