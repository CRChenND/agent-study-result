I've clicked the Back button multiple times trying to get to the appointment selection page, but I'm still on the customer information page. I need to find another way to select a valid future appointment date.

[2025-04-08 23:13:37,690] INFO - 🧠 Memory: I'm scheduling a motorcycle knowledge test appointment for John Davis on the Virginia DMV website. I've returned to the home page to restart the appointment scheduling process. The previously selected appointment date (March 24, 2025) was in the past compared to the current date (April 8, 2025, 23:13), which was causing issues with proceeding. I need to select a new, valid future appointment date. User information: John Davis, DOB: 06/20/1990, address: 123 Main Street, Los Angeles, CA 90001, phone: (213) 555-0198, email: john.davis87273@gmail.com.
