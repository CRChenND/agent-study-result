[2025-04-08 23:32:41,933] INFO - 🧠 Memory: I'm scheduling a motorcycle test appointment for John Davis at the Virginia DMV. The original task requested a Knowledge Test, but the current appointment is for a Skills Test instead. I've made multiple attempts to fill out the customer information form (step 6 of 8) with John's details (name: John Davis, phone: 2135550198, email: john.davis87273@gmail.com) but keep getting reset to the same page. I've tried clicking the Back button twice to try to navigate to earlier steps where I might be able to change the test type. The appointment is currently for Monday March 24, 2025, 8:30 AM at the Abingdon location. Current date is April 8, 2025.
