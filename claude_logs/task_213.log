I have completed these steps:
1. Completed security verification by submitting the health insurance number
2. Tried multiple approaches to search for a car in North Las Vegas/Las Vegas Airport on April 29, 2025 from 6:00 PM to 11:00 PM

The site keeps returning to the main page with default values. The current date is April 9, 2025, and I'm trying to book for April 29, 2025. Since the search function on this demo site appears to be limited, I'll try to click directly on the Avis logo (our preferred supplier) to attempt booking directly with them.
