I need to explore these options to find a doctor meeting all three criteria (Botox specialist, virtual visits, accepts CareCredit).

Current status: I'm on the CareCredit doctor locator page for cosmetic providers.

I need to either check individual provider details or search specifically for virtual visit availability. The date I need to schedule for is April 20, 2025.

Current status: I've found Milan Laser South Bend Er, a Medical Aesthetics provider who accepts CareCredit. Their specialties include Dermatologist, Facial Plastic Surgeon, Medical Aesthetics, and Cosmetic services - which suggests they likely offer Botox, but this isn't explicitly confirmed. There's no indication they offer virtual visits. 

I need to continue searching for providers who specifically offer Botox treatments via virtual visits and accept CareCredit. The current provider doesn't clearly meet all three criteria.
