[2025-04-08 23:39:59,726] INFO - 🧠 Memory: I need to schedule a motorcycle knowledge test appointment. I'm still on the Customer Information page (step 6 of 8). The current appointment is for a Motorcycle SKILLS Test, not a KNOWLEDGE Test as required. The appointment is scheduled for Abingdon on March 24, 2025 at 8:30 AM. I've filled in John Davis's details (Name, Phone: (213) 555-0198, Email) multiple times and tried clicking both Back and Next buttons, but I remain on step 6. I may need to start fresh and look for a way to specifically select a knowledge test rather than a skills test. Current date is April 8, 2025.
