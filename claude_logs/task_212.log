[2025-04-09 00:18:05,376] INFO - 🧠 Memory: I have calculated the affordable rent based on an annual income of $130,000 in Los Angeles. Using the standard 30% rule (rent shouldn't exceed 30% of gross monthly income), the affordable monthly rent would be $3,250. This is calculated as: $130,000 (annual income) ÷ 12 months = $10,833 monthly income × 0.30 = $3,250 monthly rent. This leaves about $7,583 per month for other expenses.
